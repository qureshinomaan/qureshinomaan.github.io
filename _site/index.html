                <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Hi! I am a fifth-year student in the integrated BS/MS program at IIIT Hyderabad, India. I am interested in machine learning for robot manipulation. I am an undergraduate researcher at Robotics Research Center, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Prof. K. Madhava Krishna</a>.</p>

<p>I spent my summer of 2021 and 2022 working with <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/david-held/">Prof. David Held</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I formulated a differentiable version of linear dynamic systems, which could be used as a building block to accelerate the learning and transfer of policies.</p>

<p>I also collaborate with <a href="https://makarandtapaswi.github.io">Prof. Makarand Tapaswi</a> on a project that aims to learn manipulation policies directly from human demonstrations like <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/something-something-v2">these</a>.</p>

<p><b><span style="color:red">Long-Term Goals</span></b></p>

<p>Growing up in a rural area, I have seen the impact of automation tools on people’s lives. I have witnessed how even something as simple as an electronic mixer can save a mother hundreds of hours, helping her focus on her children’s education. My long-term goal is to build robots that can automate trivial aspects of people’s daily lives. For example, imagine a single parent who doesn’t have to worry about cleaning their home or cooking food. They can spend their time with their child or advance their careers. I hope that the algorithms I design during my career will help people focus on what matters in their lives.</p>

<p><b><span style="color:red">Current Focus</span></b></p>

<p>I want to work at the intersection of robotics, vision and reinforcement learning to build manipulation algorithms that can act in unstructured real-world environments. Currently, I am focused on the following directions to achieve this goal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><span style="color:red">Manipulation specific Inductive biases for RL</span></b>: Can we design inductive biases specific to manipulation to make exploration in RL more efficient?  For example, we know that while performing a task like ‘opening a bottle,’ the trajectory of the robot should be smooth. How can we design inductive biases for RL, which uses this knowledge to focus its exploration on harder parts of the problem (like the trajectory required for rotating the bottle’s cap)?</li>
  <li><b><span style="color:red">Learning From Demonstrations</span></b>: We humans, can often watch a YouTube tutorial like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4G7iF8NKJ0">this</a> and learn new skills. We extract important information about trajectory and object property from videos and build on them to perform complicated behaviors. I aim to build algorithmic pipelines which facilitate similar learning of manipulation skills for robots from such widely available data sources as YouTube videos.</li>
  <li><b><span style="color:red">Object-Centric Representations</span></b>: So much of robotic manipulation requires dealing with complex objects. However, our knowledge about representing such objects is fairly trivial. For example, how do we represent an object as complex as an egg which changes its shape and form over the course of its manipulation? In my research, I want to design representations of objects such that makes their downstream manipulation easier.</li>
</ul>
