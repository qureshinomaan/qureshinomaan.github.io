Hi! I am a third year student in the integrated BS/MS program at IIIT Hyderabad, India. I am interested in Statistics and Machine Learning, and their applications in Embodied Vision.

## Interests

I am exploring the field of Machine Learning (ML). I find it fascinating that starting with bulding blocks in Probabilistic and Statistical thinking and throwing in some Linear Algebra and Calculus in the mix, we can accomplish extremely powerful function approximators that can emulate knowledge-based reasoning. At present I am focusing on laying down firm roots in the basics, and taking an applied look at ML and Computer Vision (CV). As I move forward, I will explore the theoritical aspects of ML and CV more deeply when I am better equipped with fundamental tools.

If you're in Hyderabad area and are looking for collaborators for ML/CV projects, please feel free to get in touch!

I am additionally interesting in learning new things - this could be anything interesting in mathematics or computer science.
