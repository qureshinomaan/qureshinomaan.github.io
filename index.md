## About Me

Hi! I am a first-year MS Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in machine learning for robot manipulation. 

Before that, I completed my integrated BS/MS degree from IIIT Hyderabad. I was an undergraduate researcher at Robotics Research Center, advised by [Prof. K. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en).

I spent my summers of 2021 and 2022 working with [Prof. David Held](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/david-held/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I formulated a differentiable version of linear dynamic systems, which could be used as a building block to accelerate the learning and transfer of polic09/09/2023 : Our paper on time-based inductive bias for RL policies got accepted to an IROS Workshop!ies.

I also collaborate with [Prof. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io) on a project that aims to learn manipulation policies directly from human demonstrations like [these](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/something-something-v2).

If you're looking for collaborators for Robotics/ML projects, please feel free to get in touch!
